# Productboard's TSlint Rules

There are highly experimental rules we are trying to use in our daily life to help maintain code more effectively. Because the the rules are tied to our codebase it will be probably very difficult to use them in your project. However, you can definitely take a look! ðŸ’ª

## Rules

### check-unused-selectors

This rule check if our `connect` (Flux) or `selector` implementation has all required dependencies, or if there is some dependency unused. If you are wondering, how this works in real life just ping us â€“ we are hiring. ðŸ¤“

### import-group-order

This rule needs configuration to proper usage. Basically you are able to set convention how to group and sort imports based on naming convention of imports. Check it out tests for real-case usage.
